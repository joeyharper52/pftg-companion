🌌 PFTG & FIRE-G Companion

A visual and conceptual companion to the Pressure-Field Theory of Gravity (PFTG) and its parallel framework FIRE-G. This site illustrates the evolution of both paths, explains their foundations, and showcases key diagrams, predictions, and core ideas — bridging rigorous physics with an accessible narrative.

⸻

🔭 Purpose

This repository provides a dark-themed, lightweight visual guide that complements the full technical papers and Zenodo records:
	•	🌀 PFTG explores gravity and interactions through scalar pressure gradients in flat spacetime, offering testable and practical approaches.
	•	🔥 FIRE-G reinterprets gravity and gauge forces via entropy gradients in curved spacetime, leading to a bold fully unified TOE vision.
	•	📊 Includes figures for soliton wave packets, scalar field modes, entropy knots, and energy densities.
	•	🌐 Links directly to Zenodo releases, GitHub codebases, and full PDFs.
	•	🧠 Designed to be accessible to curious readers while retaining scientific depth.
