# 🌌 PFTG Companion Site

A visual and conceptual companion to the **Pressure-Field Theory of Gravity (PFTG)** and its earlier formulation, **FIRE-G**. This site explains the evolution of the theory, illustrates its foundations, and showcases key predictions, interactive visuals, and core equations.

## 🔭 Purpose

This repository hosts a lightweight, dark-themed visual guide to the PFTG framework:
- 📘 Introduces the transition from **FIRE-G** (Field-Induced Radiant Energy Gravity) to full **PFTG**
- 📊 Includes diagrams showing scalar field modes, energy densities, and soliton analogs
- 🌐 Links back to the full technical papers and Zenodo records
- 🧠 Offers simplified public explanations alongside rigorous foundations
